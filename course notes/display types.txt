3 display types learn so far: block, inline, inline-block.

Block follows the usual box system, adds a new box underneath the current one.
Inline is just in the current box, can't really set width or height and any margin/padding/border will likely overlap with the rest of the box. It's displayed next to the content of
the box it's in, as long as there's space.
inline-block is a way to have it be in the current box but while also being able to use width, height, and generally make it act more like a box

Examples of elements with default behavior of block: h1, div, p, ol, ul, li
Examples of elements with default behavior of inline: a, span, b, i, img, button

FLEXBOX:

Flexbox has a container and elements inside it. The container acts like a box and can have margin, padding, border, etc. 
The elements inside it are arranged as columns that take up equal space by default. Each element can be given margin, padding, border, etc.
IMPORTANT: an element of a flexbox container can itself be also a container, and it can also have more than one block.
Flexbox is a very powerful tool for arranging elements and preferrable to inline-block usually.
